"""Grading-company lookups and comment parsing.

CardMarket has no structured field for professional grading: a seller with a
slabbed card writes it into the free-text comment. In practice that means a
company token next to a number, wrapped in whatever decoration the seller's
listing tool produces -- ``PSA 10``, ``[BGS 9.5]``, ``CGC Pristine 10``,
``_PSA 10_ Since 1996``, ``< PGS 9.5 >``, ``1132/5000 BGS10 SUB: 9.5 10 10 10``.

``parse_grade`` turns that into a (company, grade) pair. It is deliberately
conservative: a comment that mentions a grader without an adjacent number, or
that speculates about one, yields no grade. Everything it is unsure about comes
back flagged so the backfill can show it rather than guess.
