# CardWatcher

A Windows app for tracking CardMarket trading-card listings over time — price changes, new/sold listings, supply trends, and your personal collection.

![Dashboard](image-files/main-page.jpeg)

## Download

**[⬇ Download CardWatcher.exe](https://github.com/langhannes/cardwatcher/raw/main/dist/CardWatcher.exe)** (Windows, ~29 MB) — no installation needed. After downloading, follow the one-time data setup in [Quick Start](#quick-start-windows) below.

## Features

- **Dashboard**: home-page overview — biggest price movers, biggest net supply losses, and pressure/divergence signals.
- **Market price**: one representative number per card (average condition, usual language) via **Floor**, **Sold**, and **Blend**, overlaid on the price chart and shown next to "From" in search.
- **Price & sold tracking**: available and ended/sold price averages with change over 1W / 1M / 2M / 6M.
- **From & Floor**: raw lowest and filtered buy-now price per card, each with its period change.
- **Price chart**: quantity-weighted average with IQR outlier filtering.
- **Availability chart**: existing vs. newly listed stock and sold quantities per day/week/month, with a drainage % line.
- **Supply metrics**: per-card Net Supply Change, Drainage, and Inflation; sort the gallery by any of them. Every supply figure counts **copies, not listings** — a row offering 40 copies is 40 items of stock — so the stock number and the +added/−sold beside it are always in the same unit.
- **Market language, overridable**: every price figure describes one language, picked from all copies on offer (graded included). If the automatic pick is wrong for a card, set it by hand on the card page.
- **Graded copies count as stock**: a slab on offer is still a copy you can buy, so it is included in the availability total, with the graded share shown beside it (e.g. `5 incl. 5 graded`). Prices stay raw-only, since a PSA 10 and a raw NM are not two samples of one price.
- **History**: per-listing quantity and add/sell/relist history tracked over time.
- **Collection**: track owned cards (quantity, condition, language) and see total value.
- **Automated downloads**: a background priority queue refreshes all cards while letting an individual **Download** jump the line; an optional daily auto-refresh keeps data current on its own.
- **Import & Sync page**: one place for the download queue, adding a card by URL, importing saved downloads, the download/import settings, daily auto-refresh, and data sync — reached from the **Import & Sync** button in the header.
- **Data sync**: pull shared data, optionally push your downloads back.
- **Search, sort & archive**: filter by name, sort by price/change/metric, archive cards you no longer track.
- **Dark mode**: a ☾ / ☀ toggle in the header switches the whole app between light and dark; your choice is remembered.

## Quick Start (Windows)

### Option 1: Pre-built executable

1. [Download `CardWatcher.exe`](https://github.com/langhannes/cardwatcher/raw/main/dist/CardWatcher.exe) (or grab it from the `dist/` folder).
2. Clone the data repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/langhannes/cardwatcher-data.git
   ```
3. Run `CardWatcher.exe`. On first launch, point it at your `cardwatcher-data` folder.

The app opens in your browser automatically. If port 5000 is busy, it picks the next free one.

### Option 2: Run from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/langhannes/cardwatcher.git
git clone https://github.com/langhannes/cardwatcher-data.git
cd cardwatcher
pip install -r requirements.txt
python cardwatcher.py
```

Options: `-p 8080` (port), `--no-browser` (don't auto-open).

### Running the tests

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m pytest
```

(`requirements-dev.txt` is kept separate from `requirements.txt` so test deps stay out of the packaged executable.)

## Using CardWatcher

The dashboard and the search gallery are rendered **client-side** in your browser: they load a lightweight card index from `/api/manifest` plus `price_history.json` and build the grids with JavaScript (`static/viewer/`), which keeps them responsive as your tracked-card count grows. Individual card pages are still rendered server-side.

### Dashboard (home page)

The home page summarises the most notable movements across all tracked cards in three panels:

- **Biggest price movers** — the top gainers and fallers ranked by their 1-week change in the market floor. Limited to cards with at least 10 available, so thin listings don't dominate. The floor is used rather than the blended price because the blend reacts to realized sales, so a single graded/PSA copy selling for a multiple of the raw price would show up as a large "move" the ask floor never made.
- **Net supply loss** — cards whose available supply shrank the most over the past week, i.e. are being bought up faster than they are relisted. Again limited to cards that started the week with ≥10 available.
- **Pressure / divergence** — cards where the *price* move and the *supply* move disagree, which can be an early signal. Each card is bucketed as:
  - **Coiling** — supply has drained sharply but the price hasn't moved yet. The scarcity isn't priced in, so there may be upward pressure building.
  - **Overbought** — the price rose without supply shrinking. The move isn't backed by scarcity and may not hold.
  - **Cooling** — the price rose, but supply is *growing* (sellers piling in), which tends to cap or reverse the rise.

Use the search box or **Browse all cards** for the full gallery.

### Browse all cards

![Browse all cards](image-files/search.png)

A sortable gallery of every tracked card. Each card shows **Avail**, **Sold**, **From**, and **Floor** prices (each with its change for the selected period) plus a stock badge with quantity, +added/−sold, and Net Supply Change % (green = growing, red = shrinking) — all three in copies, so they read against each other. Sort by name, price, price change, lowest price, or a supply metric, over Last Download / 1W / 1M / 2M / 6M. The starting sort order, period, and price type come from **Display Defaults** in **Settings**, so the gallery opens the way you prefer.

### Card detail

![Card Detail View](image-files/individual-page.jpeg)

The **price chart** shows the card's value four ways:

- **Trend** (blue) — quantity-weighted average of all current asking prices, with IQR outlier filtering. This is every listing, regardless of condition or language.
- **Floor** (orange) — the realistic buy-now price: the low band of asking prices, filtered to average condition and the card's market language (so one beat-up or off-language cheapie doesn't define it).
- **Sold** (red) — a time-weighted average of prices that actually sold, with recent sales weighted more heavily.
- **Blend** (green) — the headline "market price": a weighted mix of **Sold** and **Floor**, meant to be the single most representative number.

Above the chart, **Market language** shows which language those price figures describe — **Floor**, **Sold** and **Blend** are all filtered to one, because an English copy and a Japanese copy of the same card are two markets at two price levels. It is worked out from every copy on offer, graded ones included, and picks the most widely printed language available (English, then Japanese, then Chinese, then Korean). That rule of thumb does get cards wrong — a Japanese-only promo with a couple of imported English slabs on it will price itself in English — so the dropdown lets you pin the language yourself; **Automatic** hands the choice back and shows what it would pick.

Below the chart, the page lists every listing (seller, price, condition; rows color-coded for new / sold / quantity change), per-listing price history, country/language filters, and per-card **Download** / **Change Link** / **Archive** buttons. The filters survive archiving, unarchiving and deleting a row, so tidying up a listing no longer makes you re-pick them. A second **availability chart** shows existing vs. new stock and sold per day/week/month with a drainage % line (aggregated to weeks beyond 1 month, months beyond 6). Both charts share the 1M / 3M / 6M / All range buttons.

### Collection

Click **My Collection** to view only cards you own, with per-card and total value. To add a card: on its detail page open the **My Collection** section, set quantity / language / condition, and **Add to Collection**. Your collection stays private on your computer.

### Syncing

On the **Import & Sync** page (header button), use **Pull** (fetch latest shared data) and **Full Sync** (pull + push your local downloads; needs git credentials).

## Downloading Card Data

CardMarket uses Cloudflare protection, so pages are fetched via built-in browser automation or saved manually.

- **Automated** — open the **Import & Sync** page and click **Refresh all now** to refresh all tracked cards (**Stop** to cancel), or the **Download** button on a single card's page. Downloads run through a single background queue: an individual **Download** jumps ahead of a running full refresh and starts as soon as the current page finishes, so it never blocks.
- **Manual** — open the listing on CardMarket, click every "Show More", then save (Ctrl+S) as "Webpage, Complete" into the `downloads/` folder in your data directory. CardWatcher imports it on the next refresh, or use **Import & Sync → Import saved downloads**.

Download/import behaviour (wait times, page-load timeout, "Show More" limit, headless/minimized browser) is configured under **Download & Import Settings** on the same page; the full settings list still lives under **Settings**.

**Daily auto-refresh:** enable **Daily Auto-Refresh** (on the Import & Sync page or in **Settings**) to run a full refresh once a day automatically (it also catches up on launch if the last run was over a day ago). While enabled, opening a page no longer triggers an import — the queue worker owns it.

### Adding a new card

- **Paste URL (easiest)** — on the **Import & Sync** page, paste a CardMarket listing URL into the **Add a Card** box and press **+ Add**. Works with any language path (`/en/`, `/de/`, `/fr/`, …).
- **Manual** — save the page as described above; the new card is imported automatically.

### When CardMarket moves a card

CardMarket sometimes reshuffles products, so a card ends up under a new URL (a renamed set, an added `-V1` suffix). Downloading it under the new address would start a second, empty history. Instead open the card, click **Change Link**, paste the new CardMarket URL and save: the tracked history, the card image, the stored prices and your collection entries all move to the new address, and the card reopens under it.

## Data Storage

- **Card data** — your chosen data directory (`cardwatcher-data/`): `pages/` (active), `archive/`, `images/`, `changes/` (metrics), `downloads/` (temp HTML).
- **Collection & settings** — your home directory (`~/.cardwatcher_collection.json`, `~/.cardwatcher_settings.json`).

## Building the Executable

Build inside a clean virtualenv holding only CardWatcher's dependencies, so PyInstaller can't bundle unrelated packages and bloat the binary (see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md)):

```bash
py -3.12 -m venv .venv-build
.\.venv-build\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt pyinstaller
.\.venv-build\Scripts\pyinstaller.exe cardwatcher.spec
```

The ~30 MB executable lands in `dist/`.

## Supported Games

Any game on CardMarket — Pokémon, One Piece, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Magic: The Gathering, and more.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Address already in use"** — run on another port: `python cardwatcher.py -p 5001`.
- **Downloader fails** — ensure Chrome is installed and current; it auto-restarts on browser crashes.
- **No listings shown** — make sure every "Show More" was clicked before saving the page.
